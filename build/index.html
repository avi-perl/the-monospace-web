<h1 id="diy-camera-clip-for-mirrorless-film-cameras">DIY Camera Clip For Mirrorless &amp; Film Cameras</h1>
<p><em><strong>Summery:</strong>  An oversize pen-clip like attachment can be made with simple tools to attach mid-sized cameras to a pant
pocket, removing the need for camera straps and other complicated hardware alternatives.</em></p>
<p>After 6 years of total burnout from a career in commercial photography, an interest in taking photos has started to grow
on me, this time in the form of film photography and film development. I've got a long term goal of taking photos of my
children, developing the film, printing the photos in a darkroom, and then hanging them in hand built frames. (
Full-stack photography?) To that end, I've started to take a camera with me when I take my children out to places.</p>
<h3 id="my-goal">My goal</h3>
<p>I'd like to be able to grab a camera and keep it with me while playing in a park, walking around a museum, and doing all
the activities that dads do with their kids. It must not get in the way, must be comfortable, and be quick to access and
put away. Modifying the camera is not allowed, and while blocking the film door is ok, ideally I'd like not to.
Attaching something significant to the camera or elaborite setup is a no go, so that rules out options I like for SLR
cameras like the <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/collections/clips/products/capture">Capture from Peak Design</a> or a camera
strap,
even <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/cdn/shop/products/1-LIGHTBOX-1024x1024-SLIDE-BLACK-03_67e19b2f-600d-4ad5-bd21-df8fc5805649_1024x1024.jpg?v=1625162779">worn as a sling</a>. (
Have you tried holding a toddler when in a sling?!)</p>
<h2 id="attempt-0-cuff">Attempt 0 - Cuff</h2>
<p>My first attempt at a solution was to use a <a href="https://www.peakdesign.com/products/cuff">Peak Design Cuff</a> wrapped around
my belt. This works really well as long as you do not move around. The camera swings from just walking, it is not easy
to get on and off, and requires setup and a belt. This does not work when the kids are already in the car and I just
remembered to grab a camera!

<h2 id="attempt-1-pant-clips">Attempt 1 - Pant Clips</h2>
<p>Many cordless drills come with a belt clip so that you can take your drill with you, freeing your hands.
<img alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86095449/256671552-a6a687e8-9dfa-4ef0-86f1-7ba08087edc3.png" />
This is nearly a perfect match to my requirements, but would not last a second when trying to catch up with a 2 year old
while your 5 year old runs in the opposite direction! So I tried buying pocket clips online that I would somehow secure
to the camera, but this was a dud. The size of the clips were too small and I did not feel remotely secure in hanging a
heavy metal camera off of it.</p>
<h2 id="attempt-3-diy-pant-clip">Attempt 3 - DIY Pant Clip</h2>
<p>I concluded that making my own clip was the way to go. While I do not have the tools to bend metal, I was aware that
aluminum could be cut with woodworking tools. A quick search online told me that aluminum will crack from bending which
caused me some concern, but in the end, it seems to work well enough for this application.</p>
<p>This is not a step by step tutorial, looking at the end result kinda tells the full story. For the bar I
used <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-1-2-in-x-36-in-Aluminum-Flat-Bar-with-1-16-in-Thick-800217/204604762">1/2 inch aluminum bar stock</a>.
You will need some kind of 1/4 inch short screw as you'd find on a tripod plate, and a 1/4 drill bit. You will also need
some way to cut the metal, such as a fine toothed saw, and you will likely need to break the sharp edges with a file or
sandpaper. To bend the aluminum I used a combination of pressing the bar against a wall corner and hammering.</p>
<p>Each camera will almost definitely need a custom shape, start from your attachment point and figure out the line you
want to run to get the bar to the clipping point, folding and bending as you go. The camera will be held at 2 points,
one at the front of the clip, and at the deepest part of the clip. Hence, ideally, the longer the clip the better. A
shorter clip will lead to the lower part of the camera body being able to bend away from your body.</p>
<p>Note that if made as I have made it here, you will most likely scratch your camera. Perhaps some thin cork would help
here.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In short, a clip made from an aluminum bar is a great way to make an always-attached pant clip for a film or mirrorless
camera. This is working for me in regular pants, but better in jean style pockets. Best of all, especially for bending
down, is putting it in the waist, though returning it there one handed is not as easy.</p>
